}
\arguments{
\item{lrr}{(unsegmented) log R, in genomic sequence (all probes), with probe IDs}

\item{baf}{(unsegmented) B Allele Frequency, in genomic sequence (all probes), with probe IDs}

\item{lrrsegmented}{log R, segmented, in genomic sequence (all probes), with probe IDs}

\item{bafsegmented}{B Allele Frequency, segmented, in genomic sequence (only probes heterozygous in germline), with probe IDs}

\item{chromosomes}{a list containing c vectors, where c is the number of chromosomes and every vector contains all probe numbers per chromosome}

\item{segBAF.table}{Segmented BAF data.frame from \code{get_segment_info}}

\item{input_optimum_pair}{A list containing fields for rho, psi and ploidy, as is output from \code{runASCAT}}

\item{dist_choice}{The distance metric to be used internally to penalise a copy number solution}

\item{distancepng}{if NA: distance is plotted, if filename is given, the plot is written to a .png file (Default NA)}

\item{copynumberprofilespng}{if NA: possible copy number profiles are plotted, if filename is given, the plot is written to a .png file (Default NA)}

\item{nonroundedprofilepng}{if NA: copy number profile before rounding is plotted (total copy number as well as the copy number of the minor allele), if filename is given, the plot is written to a .png file (Default NA)}

\item{gamma_param}{technology parameter, compaction of Log R profiles (expected decrease in case of deletion in diploid sample, 100 % aberrant cells; 1 in ideal case, 0.55 of Illumina 109K arrays) (Default 0.55)}

\item{read_depth}{TODO: unused parameter that should be removed}

\item{uninformative_BAF_threshold}{The threshold beyond which BAF becomes uninformative}

\item{allow100percent}{A boolean whether to allow a 100% cellularity solution}

\item{reliabilityFile}{String to where fit reliabilty information should be written. This file contains backtransformed BAF and LogR values for segments using the fitted copy number profile (Default NA)}

\value{
A list with fields output_optimum_pair, output_optimum_pair_without_ref, distance, distance_without_ref, minimise and is.ref.better
}
\description{
This function takes an initial optimum rho/psi pair and uses
an internal distance metric to calculate a score for each rho/psi pair allowed.
The solution with the best score is then taken to obtain a global copy number
profile. This function performs both a grid search and tries to find a reference
segment, but the grid search result is always used for now.
