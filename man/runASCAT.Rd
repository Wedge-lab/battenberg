\title{A modified ASCAT main function to fit Battenberg}
\usage{
runASCAT(lrr, baf, lrrsegmented, bafsegmented, chromosomes, dist_choice,
  distancepng = NA, copynumberprofilespng = NA, nonroundedprofilepng = NA,
  cnaStatusFile = "copynumber_solution_status.txt", gamma = 0.55,
  allow100percent, reliabilityFile = NA, min.ploidy = 1.6,

}
\arguments{
\item{lrr}{(unsegmented) log R, in genomic sequence (all probes), with probe IDs}

\item{baf}{(unsegmented) B Allele Frequency, in genomic sequence (all probes), with probe IDs}

\item{lrrsegmented}{log R, segmented, in genomic sequence (all probes), with probe IDs}

\item{bafsegmented}{B Allele Frequency, segmented, in genomic sequence (only probes heterozygous in germline), with probe IDs}

\item{chromosomes}{a list containing c vectors, where c is the number of chromosomes and every vector contains all probe numbers per chromosome}

\item{dist_choice}{The distance metric to be used internally to penalise a copy number solution}

\item{distancepng}{if NA: distance is plotted, if filename is given, the plot is written to a .png file (Default NA)}

\item{copynumberprofilespng}{if NA: possible copy number profiles are plotted, if filename is given, the plot is written to a .png file (Default NA)}

\item{nonroundedprofilepng}{if NA: copy number profile before rounding is plotted (total copy number as well as the copy number of the minor allele), if filename is given, the plot is written to a .png file (Default NA)}

\item{cnaStatusFile}{File where the copy number profile status is written to. This contains either the message "No suitable copy number solution found" or "X copy number solutions found" (Default copynumber_solution_status.txt)}

\item{gamma}{technology parameter, compaction of Log R profiles (expected decrease in case of deletion in diploid sample, 100 "\%" aberrant cells; 1 in ideal case, 0.55 of Illumina 109K arrays) (Default 0.55)}

\item{allow100percent}{A boolean whether to allow a 100"\%" cellularity solution}

\item{reliabilityFile}{String to where fit reliabilty information should be written. This file contains backtransformed BAF and LogR values for segments using the fitted copy number profile (Default NA)}

\item{min.ploidy}{The minimum ploidy to consider (Default 1.6)}

\item{max.ploidy}{The maximum ploidy to consider (Default 4.8)}

\item{min.rho}{The minimum cellularity to consider (Default 0.1)}

\item{max.rho}{The maximum cellularity to consider (Default 1.0)}

\item{min.goodness}{The minimum goodness of fit for a solution to have to be considered (Default 63)}

\item{uninformative_BAF_threshold}{The threshold beyond which BAF becomes uninformative (Default 0.51)}
}
\value{
A list with fields psi, rho and ploidy
}
\description{
This function returns an initial rho and psi estimate for a clonal copy number fit. It uses an internal distance metric to create a distance matrix.
Using that matrix it will search for a rho and psi combination that yields the least heavy penalty.
